## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common User Questions:

**Q: "Is my data safe?"**
A: Yes! We use Google's standard OAuth security. We only access what you grant permission for, and you can disconnect anytime.

**Q: "What if I don't want to import everything?"**
A: You can select exactly what to import - Drive files, Calendar events, or Gmail labels. It's completely your choice.

**Q: "Can I disconnect later?"**
A: Absolutely! There's a "Disconnect Google Account" button that removes all permissions immediately.

**Q: "Will this mess up my Google account?"**
A: No, we only READ your existing content to create workflows. We don't modify or delete anything in your Google account.

This integration transforms WorkflowHub from a "build-from-scratch" platform into an "import-and-enhance" platform, making it incredibly valuable for busy influencers who already have established processes in Google's ecosystem.
